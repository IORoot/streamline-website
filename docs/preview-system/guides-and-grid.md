# Guides and Grid

The Preview Modal includes powerful alignment tools: guides and grid overlays to help you precisely position and measure elements in your preview images.

## Grid Overlay

The grid overlay displays a customizable grid pattern over your preview image, making it easy to align elements and measure distances.

### Enabling the Grid

1. Open the Preview Modal
2. Click the grid toggle button in the toolbar
3. The grid will appear over the preview image

### Grid Settings

#### Grid Size

Adjust the grid size to match your needs:
- **Range**: 1 to 100 pixels
- **Default**: 10 pixels
- **Control**: Use the grid size input field

#### Grid Appearance

- **Color**: Semi-transparent overlay
- **Pattern**: Horizontal and vertical lines
- **Snapping**: Elements can snap to grid positions

### Using the Grid

- **Alignment**: Use grid lines to align elements
- **Measurement**: Count grid units to measure distances
- **Snapping**: Guides and elements snap to grid positions when enabled

## Guides

Guides are draggable reference lines that help you align and measure elements precisely.

### Creating Guides

#### From Rulers

1. Hover over a ruler (horizontal or vertical)
2. Click and drag from the ruler into the image area
3. Release to place the guide

#### Guide Types

- **Horizontal guides**: Dragged from the top ruler
- **Vertical guides**: Dragged from the left ruler

### Managing Guides

#### Moving Guides

1. Click on an existing guide
2. Drag it to a new position
3. Release to place it

#### Deleting Guides

1. Click on a guide to select it
2. Click the delete button (X) that appears
3. Or drag the guide back to the ruler

### Guide Features

#### Snapping

- Guides automatically snap to grid positions when grid is enabled
- Snapping helps maintain precise alignment

#### Positioning

- Guides are positioned in image pixel coordinates
- Position is displayed when hovering over a guide
- Guides persist across zoom and pan operations

#### Visual Indicators

- Guides are displayed as colored lines
- Selected guides are highlighted
- Guides extend across the entire visible area

## Rulers

Rulers provide pixel-level measurements along the edges of the preview.

### Ruler Features

- **Pixel markings**: Tick marks at regular intervals
- **Labels**: Numbers at 10-pixel intervals
- **Quarter marks**: Blue markings at 25%, 50%, and 75% positions
- **Zoom-aware**: Rulers update based on zoom level
- **Pan-aware**: Rulers reflect current pan position

### Using Rulers

- **Measurement**: Read pixel positions directly from rulers
- **Guide creation**: Drag from rulers to create guides
- **Alignment**: Use ruler markings to align elements

## Best Practices

### Grid Usage

- **Small grids (1-5px)**: For pixel-perfect alignment
- **Medium grids (10-20px)**: For general alignment
- **Large grids (50-100px)**: For layout and composition

### Guide Usage

- **Create guides** for important alignment points
- **Use multiple guides** to define layout boundaries
- **Delete guides** when no longer needed to reduce clutter
- **Snap to grid** for consistent spacing

### Workflow

1. Enable grid for general alignment
2. Create guides for specific reference points
3. Use rulers to measure precise distances
4. Adjust grid size as needed for different tasks

## Tips

- Combine grid and guides for maximum precision
- Use guides to mark important positions (center, thirds, etc.)
- Adjust grid size based on your working scale
- Guides persist between sessions
- Rulers help you understand image dimensions at a glance
