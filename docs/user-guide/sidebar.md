# Sidebar

The sidebar in STREAMLINE provides access to the node library and can be displayed in three different sizes: minimal, normal, and expanded. Each mode offers different levels of detail and functionality.

## Sidebar Modes

### Minimal Mode

In minimal mode, the sidebar is collapsed to its smallest size, showing only icons. This mode maximizes the canvas workspace while still providing quick access to node categories.

**Features:**
- Icon-only display for maximum canvas space
- Quick access to node categories
- Hover to see category names
- Click icons to expand to normal mode

### Normal Mode

Normal mode is the default sidebar view, providing a balanced display of icons and text labels. This mode offers the best balance between information and workspace.

- Icons with text labels for easy identification
- Full node category names visible
- Search functionality
- Node descriptions and metadata

### Expanded Mode

Expanded mode shows the full sidebar with maximum detail, including node descriptions, icons, and additional metadata. This mode is ideal when browsing and learning about available nodes.

## Switching Between Modes

You can switch between sidebar modes using:

## Sidebar Features

### Search

The sidebar includes a search bar at the top that allows you to quickly find nodes by name. The search is available in all modes:

- Type to filter nodes in real-time
- Search matches node names and descriptions
- Results update as you type

### Node Categories

Nodes are organized into categories for easy browsing:

- **Audio Nodes**: All audio processing nodes (prefixed with `ff_a_`)
- **Video Nodes**: All video processing nodes
- **Input/Output**: Input and output nodes
- **Effects**: Color correction, filters, and effects
- **Transforms**: Scaling, rotation, cropping, etc.

### Node Information

When you select a node in the sidebar, you can see:

- Node icon
- Node name
- Brief description
- Input/output requirements
- FFMPEG filter information

## Tips

- Use **minimal mode** when you know which nodes you need and want maximum canvas space
- Use **normal mode** for general workflow - it's the best balance
- Use **expanded mode** when exploring new nodes or learning about available options
- The sidebar remembers your preferred mode between sessions
- You can pin frequently used nodes for quick access
