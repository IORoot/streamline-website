# Guides and Grid

Guides and grid overlays help you align elements, measure distances, and maintain precision in your video processing.

## Grid Overlay

The grid overlay displays a pixel grid over the preview image for alignment and measurement.

### Enabling Grid

1. Open Preview Modal
2. Click **Grid** toggle in toolbar
3. Grid appears over preview image

### Grid Configuration

**Grid Size:**
- Configurable grid spacing
- Default: 10 pixels
- Adjustable in settings
- Smaller grids for fine detail work

**Grid Appearance:**
- White lines with transparency
- Visible but not intrusive
- Adapts to zoom level
- Scales with image zoom

### Using Grid

**Alignment:**
- Align elements to grid lines
- Check positioning accuracy
- Verify symmetry
- Ensure consistent spacing

**Measurement:**
- Count grid squares for distances
- Estimate dimensions
- Check proportions
- Verify aspect ratios

## Guide Lines

Guide lines are custom alignment markers you can add to the preview.

### Adding Guides

**From Rulers:**
1. Click on horizontal ruler to add horizontal guide
2. Click on vertical ruler to add vertical guide
3. Guide appears at clicked position

**Guide Behavior:**
- Guides snap to pixel positions
- Draggable after creation
- Visible across zoom levels
- Persistent during session

### Managing Guides

**Moving Guides:**
- Click and drag guide line
- Position updates in real-time
- Snaps to pixel boundaries

**Deleting Guides:**
- Click on guide line
- Guide is removed
- Or use delete button

**Multiple Guides:**
- Add unlimited guides
- Horizontal and vertical guides
- Use for complex alignment
- Organize with spacing

## Rulers

Rulers provide pixel-accurate measurement along image edges.

### Horizontal Ruler

- Located at top of preview
- Shows pixel positions
- Tick marks every pixel
- Labels every 10 pixels
- Blue marks at 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 positions

### Vertical Ruler

- Located at left of preview
- Shows pixel positions
- Tick marks every pixel
- Labels every 10 pixels
- Blue marks at 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 positions

### Using Rulers

**Measurement:**
- Read pixel positions from rulers
- Calculate distances between points
- Verify element positions
- Check alignment

**Creating Guides:**
- Click ruler to create guide
- Guide appears at clicked position
- Useful for precise alignment

## Pixel-Perfect Mode

Pixel-perfect mode ensures exact pixel rendering.

### Enabling Pixel-Perfect

1. Open Preview Modal
2. Click **Pixel-Perfect** toggle
3. Image renders at exact pixel size

### Benefits

- **No Interpolation**: No smoothing or blurring
- **Sharp Edges**: Maintains crisp edges
- **Accurate Colors**: True pixel colors
- **Precise Inspection**: See exact pixel values

### When to Use

- **Color Work**: Accurate color inspection
- **Alignment**: Precise positioning checks
- **Text Overlays**: Verify text sharpness
- **Fine Details**: Inspect small elements

## Alignment Tools

### Rule of Thirds

Use guides to create rule of thirds:
1. Add horizontal guide at 1/3 position
2. Add horizontal guide at 2/3 position
3. Add vertical guide at 1/3 position
4. Add vertical guide at 2/3 position

### Center Alignment

Find image center:
1. Note image dimensions
2. Add guide at width/2 (horizontal)
3. Add guide at height/2 (vertical)
4. Center is at intersection

### Symmetry

Check symmetry:
1. Add vertical guide at center
2. Compare left and right sides
3. Verify mirror symmetry
4. Adjust as needed

## Measurement Techniques

### Distance Measurement

1. Note position from ruler (point A)
2. Note position from ruler (point B)
3. Calculate: distance = |B - A|
4. Use grid squares for quick estimates

### Area Measurement

1. Use grid to count squares
2. Multiply: area = squares × grid_size²
3. Or use guides to mark boundaries
4. Calculate from guide positions

## Best Practices

1. **Use Grid for General Work**: Enable grid for most alignment tasks
2. **Use Guides for Specific Alignment**: Add guides for precise positioning
3. **Enable Pixel-Perfect for Detail Work**: Use for color and detail inspection
4. **Combine Tools**: Use grid, guides, and rulers together
5. **Clean Up**: Remove guides when done

## Tips

- **Grid Size**: Adjust grid size to match your work scale
- **Guide Colors**: Guides are visible but don't obstruct preview
- **Ruler Precision**: Rulers show exact pixel positions
- **Zoom for Accuracy**: Zoom in for precise guide placement
- **Save Guides**: Guides persist during session
