# Welcome to STREAMLINE

STREAMLINE is a powerful, node-based video editing application that transforms complex FFMPEG operations into an intuitive visual workflow.

## What is STREAMLINE?

STREAMLINE is a cross-platform desktop application that revolutionizes video editing by providing a visual, node-based interface for creating complex video processing pipelines. Instead of writing complex FFMPEG commands, users drag and drop nodes onto a canvas, connect them visually, and watch their video transformations come to life in real-time.
